# SudokuBot
A bot made with Python that can solve Sudoku Puzzles with Constraint-Satisfaction Algorithms

# How to Use
The program features several different options for running </br>
</br>
Run the .py like any other python file, but with 2 parameters "python sudokuBot.py (Mode) (File)" </br>
</br>
(Mode) is the algorithm used to solve the puzzle. {1: Brute Force, 2: Back-tracking, 3: Forward Checking with Most-Restrained-Variable, 4: Test mode, Doesn't Solve Puzzles} </br> 
Brute Force is discouraged, as it could take extremely long depending on how many unfilled spaces there are. </br>
</br>
(File) is the name of the .csv file to be tested. An example file is provided in the repository. X's are used to designate spaces that are not filled. </br>
